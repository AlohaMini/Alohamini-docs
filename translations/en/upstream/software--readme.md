[← Tutorial Library](../tutorial-library.md) · **Environment and Training Tools**

This section introduces the general functions of LeRobot. Please configure the example according to the target robot, data set and operating environment; before using it with AlohaMini 2 / 2 Pro, you need to confirm the hardware and interface compatibility.

## Updates
- **[2025-07-11]** merge upstream LeRobot v0.6

## Documentation

Start with setup, then follow the workflow for your hardware. Use the reference pages when you need exact flags, commands, or low-level debug tools.

### Recommended Path

1. [Install](software--docs-alohamini-install.md) — prepare the environment, serial port permissions, and Hugging Face login.
2. Pick your robot workflow:
   - [AM-ARM200](software--docs-alohamini-am-arm200.md) — single-arm workflow on one PC: calibration, teleoperation, dataset recording, training, and evaluation.
   - [AlohaMini 1 / 2 / 2 Pro](software--docs-alohamini-alohamini.md) — dual-arm workflow with Pi + PC: calibration, teleoperation, dataset recording, training, and evaluation.
